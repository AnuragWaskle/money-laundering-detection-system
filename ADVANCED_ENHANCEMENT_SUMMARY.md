## Risk Scoring Framework

### Risk Factor Categories
1. **Velocity Risk**: Transaction frequency and timing patterns
2. **Amount Pattern Risk**: Unusual amount patterns and structuring
3. **Network Centrality Risk**: Position in transaction network
4. **Geographic Risk**: Cross-border and high-risk jurisdiction exposure
5. **Structural Risk**: Account type and ownership structure
6. **Temporal Risk**: Transaction timing and pattern analysis
7. **Counterparty Risk**: Risk assessment of connected entities

### Risk Calculation Algorithm
```python
# Weighted risk scoring:
risk_score = Σ(factor_score × factor_weight) / total_weight
risk_level = categorize_risk(risk_score)
```
