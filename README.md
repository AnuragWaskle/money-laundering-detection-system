## 🎯 Risk Scoring Framework

### 7-Factor Risk Analysis System

1. **Velocity Risk (20%)** - Transaction frequency and timing patterns
2. **Amount Pattern Risk (15%)** - Unusual amounts and structuring detection  
3. **Network Centrality Risk (20%)** - Position in transaction networks
4. **Geographic Risk (15%)** - Cross-border and high-risk jurisdiction exposure
5. **Structural Risk (10%)** - Account type and ownership complexity
6. **Temporal Risk (10%)** - Transaction timing and pattern analysis
7. **Counterparty Risk (10%)** - Risk assessment of connected entities

### Risk Level Classification

- **🔴 CRITICAL (0.8-1.0):** Immediate action, SAR filing recommended
- **🟡 HIGH (0.6-0.8):** Enhanced monitoring, additional documentation
- **🟠 MEDIUM (0.4-0.6):** Increased monitoring, periodic review
- **🟢 LOW (0.0-0.4):** Standard monitoring, regular review
